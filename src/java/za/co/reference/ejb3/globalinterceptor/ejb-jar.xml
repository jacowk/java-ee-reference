			This role represents the application's rights.  It effectively allows access to all methods.
			No user should ever be assigned this role.  It has two purposes.  The first purpose is
			to secure access to methods which should never be invoked outside of the application.
			The second purpose is to define a role which can form part of a method-permission declaration
			which allows access to all methods.  This is necessary, as the EJB 2.0 specification implies
			that all methods must have a method-permission defined.
